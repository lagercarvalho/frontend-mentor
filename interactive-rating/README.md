## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge was my first implementation with javascript and was a great way to get introduced to it. I continued sharpening my skills in css which is feeling easier and easier.


### Continued development

I'm still not entirely happy with the organisation of the css and namings of different classes. This will need some continued work.
