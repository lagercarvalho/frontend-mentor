## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

### What I learned

In this challenge I built on the JS animation code from the last challenge and modified it to suit my needs in this challenge which I would not have been able to do previously.

### Continued development

As always, the naming conventions are slightly lacking.
Get a better grip of how to use JS files which import some module, had some difficulties with this.
