### What I learned

In this challenge I built a carousel which updates several components on the page. I had not previously worked with svg's and I learned how to modify them to be able to scale them.
Also this challange was particularly difficult due to the layers of overlapping elements which was hard to deal with.

### Continued development

As always, the naming conventions are slightly lacking.
I find that the css files are a bit messy, have to work on cleaning them up in the future.
