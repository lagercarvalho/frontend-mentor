## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first project in css, so i've learnt a lot about everything but specifically flexbox and do's and don'ts in css.

### Continued development

The flexbox work definitely needs improving.
